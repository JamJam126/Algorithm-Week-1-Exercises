/**
 * Create a basic money converter that convert an amount between USD and local currency (KHR).
 * 
 * Exchange rate: 1 USD = 4100 KHR
 * 
 * Tips:
 * - Use float to store money values
 * - Ask user which direction to convert:
 *    - 1 = USD to KHR
 *    - 2 = KHR to USD
 * - Use if-else to handle the choice
 * 
 * Example:
 * Enter option (1 = USD to KHR, 2 = KHR to USD): 1
 * Enter amount: 10
 * 10 USD = 41000 KHR
